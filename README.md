# hello-world

Hello world,

This is the beginning of a journey into coding I have actively avoided for years.  Opportunity has forced my hand.  I write simple scripts and html/css, but no real experience in object-oriented programming.  Javascript is transforming how webpages are created, and I'm here to jump on the bandwagon.

My mission is to track my progress for others to use as inspiration.  I will begin with node.js.
